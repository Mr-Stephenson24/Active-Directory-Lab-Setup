# Active-Directory-Lab-Setup

This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of a Windows Active Directory (AD) Lab in a virtualized environment. The goal of this lab is to replicate a real-world enterprise environment for practicing identity management, authentication, group policy, and security monitoring

 Lab Components

Domain Controller (Windows Server) – Configured with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).

Windows 10/11 Clients – Joined to the domain for centralized management.

Active Directory Users & Groups – Created to simulate a corporate environment.

Group Policy Objects (GPOs) – Used to enforce security policies, drive mapping, and desktop restrictions.

DNS & DHCP Services – Configured for name resolution and IP address assignment.

 Tools & Technologies

VirtualBox / VMware / Hyper-V (for virtualization)

Windows Server 2019/2022

Windows 10/11

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
